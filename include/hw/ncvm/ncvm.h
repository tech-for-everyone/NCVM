 * ncvm portal device model
 *
 * The ncvm device is a small, self-contained "portal" that exposes the

 * Its MMIO and I/O-port memory handlers are implemented in Rust
 * (see rust/hw/ncvm/), mirroring the upstream pl011/hpet Rust devices.
 *
 * This work is part of the NCVM project (https://github.com/tech-for-everyone/NCVM).
